## Core functionality
This application parses product and discount data from CSV files and links them using in-memory maps based on a composite key of `productId` and `store`. It exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints for:
* Retrieving product information and associated discounts
* Getting the best currently available discounts
* Identifying newly added discounts
* Viewing historical price trends for individual products
  * Provides timestamped price data (including discounted prices) per product
  * Allows filtering by store
* Enabling users to find the best buy products by name (with optional brand filtering) to help compare prices effectively regardless of pack size
  * Highlights "value per unit" (e.g., price per kg, price per liter)
  * Allows filtering by product brand
* Creating and monitoring price alerts
  * Users can set a target price for a product
  * The system checks for active discounts and alerts users when the target price is reached
  
The data model separates products and discounts for modularity and scalability, while a central service efficiently binds them together for query operations.
